# Decision Tree
# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of patient characteristics and medical history. It utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to classify patients based on risk factors and predicts the likelihood of heart disease. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Heart Disease Dataset" and it contains the following features:

- **age:** Age of the patient
- **sex:** Sex of the patient (Male/Female)
- **cp:** Chest pain type (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic)
- **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
- **chol:** Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (True/False)
- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results (normal, having ST-T wave abnormality, showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang:** Exercise induced angina (Yes/No)
- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (upsloping, flat, downsloping)
- **thal:** Thalassemia (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect)
- **num:** Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (0-4, where 0 indicates no disease and 4 indicates severe disease)
