# KNN
# Zoo Animal Classification

This project aims to classify animals in a zoo based on their characteristics using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Zoo" dataset, which contains information about various animals, including their physical attributes and classification. The dataset is available in the `Zoo.csv` file.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and necessary preprocessing steps are performed, such as handling missing values and scaling features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to gain insights into the dataset and identify relevant features for classification.

3. **Model Selection:** The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is chosen for classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness for this type of problem.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The KNN model is trained using a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's accuracy.

5. **Visualization:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes. Decision boundaries of the KNN model are plotted to understand its classification behavior.

## Results

The trained KNN model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test set. The classification report and confusion matrix provide detailed information about the model's performance for each animal class.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of the KNN algorithm for classifying zoo animals based on their characteristics. The results show that the model can effectively predict the animal type with a high degree of accuracy. Further improvements could be explored by using different algorithms or feature engineering techniques.
