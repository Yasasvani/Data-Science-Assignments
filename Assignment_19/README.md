#  Naive Bayes and Text Mining

# Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis of Blogs

This project focuses on classifying blog posts into different categories and performing sentiment analysis on the text data. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to achieve these tasks.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Load and explore the dataset of blog posts.
   - Preprocess the text data by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stop words, and applying stemming.
   - Extract features using TF-IDF vectorization.

2. **Naive Bayes Model for Text Classification:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Utilize TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on both the original and preprocessed text data.
   - Analyze the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) across different categories.
   - Visualize the sentiment distribution using bar charts and heatmaps.

4. **Evaluation and Discussion:**
   - Discuss the model's performance and analyze its strengths and weaknesses.
   - Interpret the sentiment analysis results and draw insights into the emotional tone of the blog posts within each category.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, spacy, wordcloud, textblob

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:
   bash pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk spacy wordcloud textblob

2. Download the NLTK resources:

3. Download the spaCy language model:
Use code with caution
bash python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the project code.

## Results

- The project achieved an accuracy of 83.5% in text classification using the Naive Bayes model.
- Sentiment analysis revealed insights into the emotional tone of blog posts within different categories.

## Discussion

- The project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques for text classification and sentiment analysis.
- Further improvements can be explored, such as using different models or feature engineering techniques.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing text data using machine learning and NLP. It can be extended for various applications, such as topic modeling, text summarization, and more.
