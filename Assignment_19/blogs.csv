I'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them
to kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between
motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'
atoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather
depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about
Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.
It's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls
apart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly
harmless.

Not necessarily.  ""Love thy neighbour"" does not supply a them/us - it
demolishes it.  And my definition of religion is broader than my
definition of theism, as I have explained.

Not in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure
point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this
(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad
too say ""religion did this"".  I'm saying that the causes are far more
complex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You
know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the 
killing', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not
to read minds.

The general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that
religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's
not nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart
from violence of course.

It is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.  None of these

When you say, ""By definition"", what exactly is being defined;
certainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the ""rules of
nature"" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but
actually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your

Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy 
hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in 
Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought 
from this dude (you guessed it, a prophet) named Mohammed.  I've
got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks, then Manny, 
my mechanic, tells me it was loaded with sawdust!  Take a guess

True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos
the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from
the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially
after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It
seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,
that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like
they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was ""nice and clean"" (smart
missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,
dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!

I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb
should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,
inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back
for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.

Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan
was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,
the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's
ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.

I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made
which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the 
circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the
suffering caused by those decisions.

Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US
and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other
back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't
care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured
in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion
by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil 
interests, caused us to take action.

I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the
war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep
Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.

They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?
The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many
innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,
but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.

Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each
and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor
are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or
some other places.

Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale
where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed
unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue
is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but
it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize
the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial 
prejudice thrown around.

No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks

Germans, perhaps.  ""Peers"" doesn't mean ""those who do the same thing"",
like having murderers judge murderers.  It means ""having people from
the same station in life"", presumably because they are in a better
position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).

The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing
liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give
a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative
sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)

BTW, I never used the word ""conspiracy"".  I don't accept (without *far*
more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal
conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.

Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people
if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and
there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then
innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say

I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain
and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That
conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.
And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't
mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as
being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of
an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed
necessary enough to go ahead with it.

But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I
don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult
decision under difficult circumstances.

Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to
those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply
refuse to condemn them for their decision.

One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;

> 
> mathew

And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was
because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
""so deplorable"".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,
precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians
(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing
in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some
civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than
any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives
with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories
of ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.
Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years
and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But 
we are expected to swallow that ""hundreds of thousands"" of 
*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with 
the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  
What hogwash.  If ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilians died,

Perhaps the major difference here is that we notice something, which we call
gravity, and then do some modelling around it.  I myself do not notice any
deity.  Hence a model cannot be made.  A deity is an abstract, and hence
religion may be considered a model of an abstract.

Besides, we can always change the model of gravity if the one we have doesn't
work too well.  Can you imagine this with the bible?  Erm, excuse me, I bought
this about 1500 years ago and it doesn't seem quite right...can I have an
improved model please?!

Twaddle. You're overloading the meaning of the word ""value"",
that's all. Whether I care if the results are true is a ""value"".
I fail to see how whether they are true (correct, whatever) is
a value.

You're overloading the value of worth, too.

Like I said before, DES works whether I value my privacy or
not.

Peter, you may assert that I am confused about this all you want, but
wishing it does not make it so.   A simple theory is not simple until
someone judges it to be.  A theory merely makes predictions.  Predictions
are not accurate until someone judges them to be.  You are choosing
theories at subjective whim, in other words?  At what point do things
get objective, Peter?

Gregg, so would you consider that Rushdie would now be left alone,

#Frank, you are attempting to inject ""goodness"" judgements where there

#""useful"" is a goodness judgement.  ""Reasonable"" is an accuracy judgement. 
#They are not the same thing at all. (""Useful in making some conclusion"" is 
#an accuracy judgement again, I'm afraid.) 

This is the root of the problem: I bloomin' well amn't punning on the
word value!!!  I know it's ambiguous.  I've told you the sense in
which I'm using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN'T mean
accuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,
is not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of
'value'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  

I can only understand that by '""useful in making some conclusion"" is an accuracy
judgement' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making
that conclusion or not.   That's part of what I mean by objective
valuation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn't value x for the 
purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn't really do that. The
rest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own 
freedom) are solid facts in themselves.

Consider each of the following statements:

(1) The only reason that the distinction between 'accurate' and 
'inaccurate' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  

(2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people
finds the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' useful in
dealing with phenomena.

(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in
modelling phenomena.

Where is the 'pun' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  
And what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that ""the 
basis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. 
'subjective' values""?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a 
'subjective' value judgement?  (an 'accurate' value judgement, maybe?)

Just to illustrate what I mean: what's the difference between saying
'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have
to model phenomena' and (say) 'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have
to achieve freedom'?  Is one 'objective', the other not?  Both are 
judgements about value (""best""), and both have the same empirical basis, from 
where _I_ sit.

#Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is
#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you
#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,
#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based
#on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,
#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.

I'm afraid I do mean to say that it's based on ""goodness"" judgements.
""Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) 
tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate 
predictions"" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.  A 
relativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of ""science"", 
or of a given scientist - but it seems pretty solid and objective to me.

I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue.
Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination,
grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme
suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to
diminished mental capacity.

At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to
authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of
obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview
rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time
a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.
He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a
respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.
After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say
it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if
you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this.
People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness
in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.

Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may
well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides
the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.

Jim,

I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at
least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,
then virtually nothing is known of the first century.

You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it
speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection
has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
atheism.

Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be?  I realize the
off-hand nature of the numbers I used.  And I can't answer as to what
an acceptable loss rate is.  However,  as I said in another post,  I
despise the idea of supporting criminals for life.  It's the economics
of the situation that concern me most.  The money spent feeding, clothing,
housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are
unfit to live in society could go to a number of places,  all of which
I, and probably others,  would consider far more worthwhile and which
would enrish the lives of all Americans.  Give people jobs,  give the
homeless shelter.  Any number of things.

#
#value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods

#sound. 
#

No, I'm using definition (3), or perhaps (4) in both cases.  If there
is no objective worth, usefulness, or importance then science has no 
objective worth, usefulness, or importance.  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable, then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable. Do you see any flaws in this?

If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,
or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.

#If you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will
#be a good beginning.

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in
dealing with observed facts.  Alternatively, you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy
or important in any situation.   In other words, I need to know
how you use the term ""objective"".

The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational
attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),
and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their
assumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's a
lack of consistency here.

Now I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God
does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational
people have problems with that ""logic""?

But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was
that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who
they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or
hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's
still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also
because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he
had wrought.

First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not
sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?

One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something
beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I for
one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.

And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.
Can love as a truth be proven, logically?

John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see
how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast
in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,
I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,
you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,
Jesus, for instance.

I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence
supporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting
love as truth is subjective.
