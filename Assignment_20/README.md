# Exchange Rate Forecasting

This assignment focuses on forecasting exchange rates using time series analysis techniques in Python. It explores two popular methods: ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing (Holt's Linear Trend).

## Dataset

The assignment uses a dataset named `exchange_rate.csv` containing historical exchange rate data. 

**Data Columns:**

- **date:** Date and time of the exchange rate observation.
- **Ex_rate:** The exchange rate value.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
   - The 'date' column is converted to datetime format and set as the index.
   - Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand data characteristics.

2. **ARIMA Modeling:**
   - Stationarity of the time series is checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
   - Differencing is applied to achieve stationarity if needed.
   - ACF and PACF plots are used to identify potential ARIMA model orders (p, d, q).
   - An ARIMA model is fitted to the training data.
   - Model diagnostics are performed to evaluate the model's fit.
   - Forecasts are generated for the test data.
   - Performance is evaluated using metrics like MSE, MAE, and MAPE.

3. **Exponential Smoothing (Holt's Linear Trend):**
   - The time series is split into training and testing sets.
   - Holt's Linear Trend model is fitted to the training data.
   - Forecasts are generated for the test data.
   - Model parameters (alpha, beta) are optimized using a grid search approach.
   - Performance is evaluated using error metrics.

4. **Model Comparison:**
   - The performance of ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing is compared based on error metrics and qualitative observations.
   - Advantages and limitations of each method are discussed.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, sklearn, itertools

## Usage

1. Upload the `exchange_rate.csv` file to your Google Colab environment.
2. Run the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook sequentially.
3. Observe the results, including data visualizations, model summaries, and performance metrics.

## Conclusion

This assignment provides a comparative analysis of ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing for exchange rate forecasting. The findings can be used to guide the selection of an appropriate model for specific forecasting scenarios.
