# Basics Of Python
This my Third Assignment. It is about basics of python.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with a collection of Python programs demonstrating various programming concepts.

The notebook (`main.ipynb`) includes the following programs:

1.  **Prime Number Checker:** Checks if a given number is prime or not.
2.  **Multiplication Quiz:** Generates two random numbers and asks the user to enter their product, providing feedback on the answer.
3.  **Squares of Even/Odd Numbers:** Prints the squares of all even or odd numbers within a specified range (100 to 200).
4.  **Word Counter:** Counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given text.
5.  **Palindrome Checker:** Checks if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## How to View and Run

1.  **View the notebook:** You can directly view the notebook (`main.ipynb`) on GitHub. It will render with the code and outputs.
2.  **Run the notebook:** To run the notebook interactively, you can:
    *   Download the notebook and open it in a local Jupyter environment.
    *   Open the notebook in Google Colab using the following link: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bq1V9KP-HQPId36O9FjvDCHYSW5V1mRI#scrollTo=A-W0FxfckiCv_)
